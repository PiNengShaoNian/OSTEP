Produce a trace of what would happen when you run these processes:
Process 0
  io

Process 1
  cpu
  cpu
  cpu
  cpu

Important behaviors:
  System will switch when the current process is FINISHED or ISSUES AN IO
  After IOs, the process issuing the IO will run LATER (when it is its turn)

答：
进程 1 （PID1）执行 IO 时,进程 2 使用 CPU，运行时间为 6 个时钟周期
