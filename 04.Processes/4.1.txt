运行结果：
Produce a trace of what would happen when you run these processes:
Process 0
  cpu
  cpu
  cpu
  cpu
  cpu

Process 1
  cpu
  cpu
  cpu
  cpu
  cpu

Important behaviors:
  System will switch when the current process is FINISHED or ISSUES AN IO
  After IOs, the process issuing the IO will run LATER (when it is its turn)

答:
CPU利用率为100%,程序没有进行IO.
