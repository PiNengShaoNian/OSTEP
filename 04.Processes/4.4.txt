Produce a trace of what would happen when you run these processes:
Process 0
  io

Process 1
  cpu
  cpu
  cpu
  cpu

Important behaviors:
  System will switch when the current process is FINISHED
  After IOs, the process issuing the IO will run LATER (when it is its turn)

在进程0进行io后操作系统不会立即切换到进程1，而是等到进程0完成再去执行进程1，总共花费9个周期完成执行。
